                <h1>Mahindra #SeedTheRise</h1>
                <p>This October, Mahindra & Mahindra initiated a massive digitally-driven crowd-funding campaign to help improve the lives of our farmers, in partnership with digital agency Flying Cursor Interactive. Named #SeedTheRise, the initiative got donations pouring in through digital amounting to INR 1 crore; this was matched by Mahindra with another INR 1 crore to add up to INR 2 crore for our farmers.
        
                        This money will be used for farmer welfare through 5 carefully selected projects in collaboration with 4 NGOs. Projects have been designed to help improve the lives of farmers and their families in varied ways such as through providing alternative forms of livelihood, educating farmers’ daughters and helping them with agricultural advancements.
                        
                        A fundraising appeal film featuring actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui, himself a farmer’s son formed the core of the campaign, leading to a donation website. The initiative also tied up with food bloggers and chefs across India who needed to create a dish in homage to the farmers and live-tweet their preparation. The social and digital mix also involved tie-ups with city-specific curation Twitter handles, live chats with the NGOs and more.

                <p>Skin care brand, Nivea India touched our hearts with its recent social initiative #MomsTouch that brought forth stories of extraordinary mothers. Nivea partnered with Aseema Charitable Trust, an organization dedicated to provide quality education to children from marginalized communities.

                        The social media driven campaign portrayed the story of some extraordinary mothers who want the best future for their child, despite having faced adversities all throughout their own lives. Viewers could join in the noble cause either by sharing the video on their social networks or by direct donations to the charitable trust. Each time one shared the film, Nivea contributed 100 grams of rice.
                        
                        Mom’s Touch helped Nivea strike the right chord with its consumers and also provided them with an incentive for social sharing.

                <h1>Make Love Not Scars ‘#EndAcidSale’</h1>
                <iframe id = "scar" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1arcR1fU4hY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>                <p>Acid attacks are a horrendous crime with lifetime consequences for the survivors. India witnesses as many as 1000 cases of acid attacks every year, acid attacks remain one of the most horrifying forms of gender based violence with almost 90% of victims being women. Yet acid is freely available at your local store, it is the cheapest way to clean toilets.

                        NGO ‘Make Love Not Scars’ that helps survivors, launched a petition campaign in association with Ogilvy & Mather, called #EndAcidSale. The idea was to move for a complete ban on toilet-cleaning acid and stronger implementation of Poisons Act and Poisons Rules.
                        
                        The initiative chose a very powerful form of storytelling, one that demanded an immediate call-for-action against such a grave crime. It roped in acid attack victim, Reshma Bano Quereshi to convince readers to sign the petition, but did so in hard-hitting satire. A series of films have her giving beauty tips on applying eye liner, lipstick and getting rid of dark spots. Towards the end of her tips, she shares about cosmetics being available for INR 100, while acid is available at just INR 30.

                <p>There’s no denying that the right celebrity endorser can boost the media coverage of a cause-related campaign. Ranveer Singh, one of India’s current favourite actor lent his magic to a noble cause campaign by Ching’s Secret.

        The premium Hakka Chinese brand walked the talk through its latest mission – ‘India Ke Hunger Ki Bajao!’ in partnership with Akshaya Patra, a not-for-profit organisation that runs the world’s largest mid-day meal programme. Ranveer, the brand ambassador spread the central message of the campaign – it takes only Rs 750 to feed a child for a whole year’.

        A digital film featured the actor having a good time with school kids, while they figured out what all can be bought with Rs. 750 in these times. A campaign website served as an information and donation hub. The cause campaign helped Ching’s Secret lend an actionable voice to its tagline, ‘Hunger Ki Bajao’.

                <p>Last year OMRON India, a world leader in industrial automation had launched a beautiful CSR initiative by way of which it could build the country’s largest audio library of poems for the visually impaired. One needed to read a poem from the available database or submit one of their own, though a specially designed site that recorded it. Interestingly, the first poem was submitted by brand ambassador Farhan Akhtar.

                This year, the award winning campaign roped in ecommerce major eBay India to add value to a user’s poem contribution. For every day of the campaign, the first 125 submissions would win an eBay voucher, using which they can shop on the platform. One could select from a vast collection of pre-recorded poems or choose one from their own collection and record it online at the campaign website.
                
                The win-win CSR campaign saw poems being recorded by Dia Mirza, Juhi Chawla, Atif Aslam, Anupam Kher, Sona Mahapatra, Rahul Bose, Amrita Puri, Rohan Joshi and many more celebrities. Read all about OMRON India ‘#PayWithYourVoice’ campaign.
